 siuethesis is a LaTeX documentclass based on the wonderful iuthesis class by Norman Danner (permission obtained). 

iuthesis is Copyright Norman Danner, 1999.
The license status of siuethesis is unknown at this time.

siuethesis is created by Adam G. Weyhaupt (aweyhau@siue.edu) and is intended to provide output acceptable to the Graduate School at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

**********************************************************************

The file siuethesis.cls is all that is needed to type your thesis; to get started quickly you can just copy these to the same directory as your thesis.

To do a normal installation of the siuethesis document class:

0) ensure that you have downloaded siuethesis.dtx and siuethesis.ins.

1) run latex (or tex) on siuethesis.ins
   result: The file siuethesis.cls has been created.
   
2) run pdflatex (or latex) on siuethesis.dtx (twice)
   result: The file siuethesis.pdf (or siuethesis.dvi) has been created.
   
3a - preferred) Move siuethesis.cls to your local texmf tree (how to do this depends on your platform, but see either the documentation for your LaTeX distribution or see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Packages/Installing_Extra_Packages)

3b - alternative) Move siuethesis.cls to the directory in which you will write your thesis.

4) Read the documentation in siuthesis.pdf (or siuethesis.dvi) which explains how to use the documentclass.

5) Typeset thesis_sample.tex to test your setup.

***********************************************************************

This class will not work out of the box on Scientific Workplace or LyX; if you are using one of these and want to help me modify the class to work with those let me know.
